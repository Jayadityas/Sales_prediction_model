# Sales_prediction_model
Overview

This project focuses on predicting sales trends using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical sales data, we build models to forecast future sales, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions and optimize their strategies.

Features

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering for better model performance.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying patterns and trends in sales data through visualization.

3. Machine Learning Models: Implementing regression models to predict future sales.

4. Feature Importance Analysis: Determining key factors influencing sales performance.

5. Model Evaluation: Comparing model accuracy using metrics like RMSE and R-squared.

Technologies Used
1. Python
2. Pandas & NumPy
3. Scikit-learn
4. Matplotlib & Seaborn
5. Jupyter Notebook

Dataset

The dataset consists of sales figures across different time periods, along with influencing factors such as product category, seasonal trends, and promotions.

Results
1.Built a predictive model with high accuracy for sales forecasting.
2.Identified key factors driving sales trends.
3.Provided actionable insights to improve business strategies.

Future Enhancements
1.Incorporating deep learning models for improved accuracy.
2.Expanding dataset to include real-time sales data.
3.Deploying the model as an API for live sales forecasting.
